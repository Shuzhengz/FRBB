# AW STM32 Test

Test for STM32F103ZETT6 MCU development board

Alientek Warship V3 W T-LCD

## Build

Build into binary using Keil µVision, and deploy by running the binary on the test board

Some of the source code may not build correctly if wrong MCU is selected in µVision

## Function

Right now it just sets up the board and does a beep, 
but I might add some other things to it... Eventually...
